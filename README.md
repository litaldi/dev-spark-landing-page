## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Enhanced Security System
```typescript
import { SecurityUtils, initializeApplicationSecurity } from '@/lib/security/consolidated-security';

// Initialize all security measures
initializeApplicationSecurity();

// Use security utilities
const cleanInput = SecurityUtils.sanitizeUserInput(userInput);
const isAuthenticated = SecurityUtils.isUserAuthenticated();
const csrfToken = SecurityUtils.getCSRFToken();
```

### Authentication with Auto-Refresh
```typescript
import { useUnifiedAuth } from '@/hooks/auth/use-unified-auth';

const { login, register, logout, currentUser, isLoading } = useUnifiedAuth({
  redirectTo: '/dashboard',
  showSuccessScreen: true
});
```
