# Testing Documentation

This project uses a comprehensive testing approach to ensure code quality, stability, and maintainability. The tests are organized by component type and functionality, focusing on unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility testing.

## Test Structure

```
src/
└── __tests__/
    ├── components/         # Tests for UI components
    │   ├── ui/             # Tests for base UI components
    │   ├── auth/           # Tests for authentication components
    │   ├── dashboard/      # Tests for dashboard components
    │   └── gamification/   # Tests for gamification components
    ├── hooks/              # Tests for React hooks
    │   └── auth/           # Tests for authentication hooks
    ├── integration/        # Tests for component interactions
    ├── accessibility/      # Tests for accessibility compliance
    └── utils/              # Test utility functions and helpers
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- src/__tests__/components/ui/Button.test.tsx
```

## Testing Approach

### Unit Tests

We use unit tests to ensure individual components and functions work correctly in isolation. These tests focus on:

- Component rendering and props handling
- Function behavior and edge cases
- Hook state management
- Error handling

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. They focus on:

- User flows (like login, registration)
- Component interactions
- Form validation and submission
- Data fetching and state updates

### Accessibility Tests

We use jest-axe to test for accessibility compliance. These tests focus on:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast and visual indicators

## Testing Best Practices

1. Test component behavior, not implementation details
2. Use meaningful test descriptions that describe expected behavior
3. Mock external dependencies to isolate the code being tested
4. Test edge cases and error states
5. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
6. Keep tests focused and small
7. Ensure tests are maintainable and descriptive

## Mocking Strategy

We use Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate components during testing:

- API calls are mocked to return predictable data
- Complex components are mocked when testing parent components
- Browser APIs (localStorage, IntersectionObserver, etc.) are mocked
- Authentication state is mocked to test different user scenarios

## Test Coverage

We aim for at least 70% code coverage across all files. Coverage reports can be found in the `coverage` directory after running tests with the coverage flag.
